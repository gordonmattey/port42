    "implementation": "<implementation_guidelines>\nIMPORTANT: Check for existing tools before creating new ones!\n\nFor git commands: Always use 'git' subprocess calls, check if in git repo first\nFor text processing: Handle both stdin and files, consider streaming\nFor Python scripts: Use argparse for CLI, include proper error handling\nDO NOT include shebang line - it will be added automatically based on language\nAdd helpful usage messages and error handling\n\nWhen generating commands that process git commits specifically:\n- Use: git log --oneline -n <limit> to get commits\n- Parse the output properly (first 7 chars are hash)\n- Handle cases where there are no commits\n\nDependencies:\n- List any external commands needed in the \"dependencies\" field\n- Common ones: lolcat, figlet, tree, jq, ripgrep, fzf\n- Example: \"dependencies\": [\"lolcat\", \"tree\"]\n- If no external dependencies, omit the field or use empty array\n\nCRITICAL: In the JSON \"implementation\" field:\n1. Use \\n for newlines between lines of code\n2. DO NOT include the shebang (#!/bin/bash etc) - it's added automatically\n3. When your code contains string literals with \\n (like split('\\n')), you must DOUBLE escape them in JSON: split('\\\\n')\n4. NEVER put actual newline characters inside the JSON string value\n\nExample for Python with string literal:\n\"implementation\": \"import sys\\nlines = text.split('\\\\n')\\nprint(lines)\"\nThis becomes: lines = text.split('\\n') in the final Python code\n</implementation_guidelines>",

When user asks for a document, app, design, or any non-CLI content, you MUST use generate_artifact\n2. For single file artifacts: populate the single_file field with content\n3.
