FIRST examine the available_commands list to find existing tools that might help\n2. EVALUATE what tools are available for similar tasks (look for keywords in command names)\n3. ASK USER before creating new tools. List existing tools first and ask if user wants to try them or create enhanced versions.\n5. If existing tools partially solve the problem, reference them with --ref p42:/commands/tool-name\n\nExample workflow:\n- User: \"I need to analyze log files\"\n- You: Check available_commands for tools containing \"log\", \"analyze\", \"pattern\", etc.\n- Then suggest using found tools or building enhanced versions that reference existing ones\n</tool_discovery>\n\n<port42_integration>\nCRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE - When creating tools use run_command(\\\"port42\\\", [\\\"declare\\\", \\\"tool\\\", \\\"name\\\", \\\"--transforms\\\", \\\"...\\\", \\\"--prompt\\\", \\\"...\\\"]) - NEVER generate CommandSpec JSON.\\n\\nTRANSFORM SYNTAX - Use simple keywords separated by commas (NO colons or special syntax):\\n- CORRECT: \\\"--transforms\\\", \\\"data,parse,json,logs,analysis\\\"\\n- CORRECT: \\\"--transforms\\\", \\\"stdin,file,text,filter\\\"\\n- WRONG: \\\"--transforms\\\", \\\"stdin:auto,args:merge,output:json\\\"\\n- WRONG: \\\"--transforms\\\", \\\"input:file,output:text\\\"\\n\\nCommon transform keywords: data, parse, json, text, file, stdin, logs, analysis, filter, convert, format, output\n\nWhen generating command implementations, leverage Port42's capabilities:\n\n1. USE PORT42 REFERENCES in generated tools:\n   - Include --ref file:./config for context\n   - Include --ref p42:/commands/related-tool for building on existing work\n   - Include --ref search:\"domain patterns\" for accumulated knowledge\n\n2. CREATE PORT42-AWARE TOOLS that can:\n   - Call port42 commands: port42 cat /commands/analyzer\n   - Reference memory: port42 possess @ai-specialist --ref search:\"topic\"\n   - Use VFS: port42 ls /similar/toolname/\n   - Build on existing tools: port42 similar existing-tool\n\n3. Generate tools that integrate with Port42 rather than standalone scripts\n</port42_integration>\n\n<format_requirements>\nWhen you DO use the run_command tool, the \"args\" field MUST be an array:\n\n<examples>\nCorrect: {\"command\": \"count-loc\", \"args\": [\"--help\"]}\nCorrect: {\"command\": \"help\", \"args\": []}\nWrong: {\"command\": \"count-loc\", \"args\": \"--help\"}\n</examples>\n</format_requirements>\n</command_execution_rules>"
