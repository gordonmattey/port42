    "implementation": "Important implementation guidelines:\n- For git commands: Always use 'git' subprocess calls, check if in git repo first\n- For text processing: Handle both stdin and files, consider streaming\n- For Python scripts: Use argparse for CLI, include proper error handling\n- DO NOT include shebang line - it will be added automatically based on language\n- Add helpful usage messages and error handling\n\nWhen generating commands that process git commits specifically:\n- Use: git log --oneline -n <limit> to get commits\n- Parse the output properly (first 7 chars are hash)\n- Handle cases where there are no commits\n\nDependencies:\n- List any external commands needed in the \"dependencies\" field\n- Common ones: lolcat, figlet, tree, jq, ripgrep, fzf\n- Example: \"dependencies\": [\"lolcat\", \"tree\"]\n- If no external dependencies, omit the field or use empty array\n\nCRITICAL: In the JSON \"implementation\" field:\n1. Use \\n for newlines, not actual newlines!\n2. DO NOT include the shebang (#!/bin/bash etc) - it's added automatically\n3. Start directly with imports or the first line of code\nExample: \"implementation\": \"echo 'hello'\\necho 'world'\"",
