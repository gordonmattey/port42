# Port 42 Fail-Fast Roadmap: Ship Magic Every Week

## Core Principle: Ship One Mind-Blowing Demo Every Week

Forget 26-week plans. We need viral moments NOW.

## Week 1: `git-haiku` (Ship by Friday)

**Why First?** Dead simple, instantly shareable, proves the concept.

**MVP Requirements:**
- Read last 5 commits
- Generate haiku for each
- Beautiful colored output

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Just pipe git log to AI with haiku prompt
git log --oneline -5 | port42 callback --prompt="haiku for each"
```

**Success Metric:** 10 developers share screenshots on Twitter

---

## Week 2: `terminal-pet` (Basic Version)

**Why Second?** Emotional connection drives retention.

**MVP Requirements:**
- ASCII art pet
- Remembers your name
- Comments on your activity
- NO complex state management yet

**Hack Implementation:**
- Store state in a simple JSON file
- Pet "sleeps" when you're away
- 5 personality traits max

**Success Metric:** Users run it daily for a week

---

## Week 3: Runtime AI Integration (Just Enough)

**Stop Building Infrastructure!** Build only what the next demo needs.

**MVP Requirements:**
- Add single endpoint: `/command-callback`
- Commands can call: `curl localhost:42/callback -d '{"prompt":"..."}'`
- That's it. No fancy architecture.

**Implementation:**
```go
// One new handler, 50 lines of code max
func (d *Daemon) handleCallback(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Parse request, call AI, return response
    // NO session management, NO complex state
}
```

---

## Week 4: `debug-detective` (Fake It First)

**The Trick:** Start with pattern matching, add AI later.

**MVP Requirements:**
- Grep for common error patterns
- Check recent git commits
- Generate plausible explanations
- Look smart

**Fake Implementation:**
```bash
# Find errors, blame recent commits
ERROR=$(grep -r "error\|Error\|ERROR" --include="*.log" .)
SUSPECT=$(git log --oneline -10 | grep -i "fix\|bug\|broken")
# Make it look like Sherlock
```

**Success Metric:** One developer says "How did it know?!"

---

## Week 5: `code-roast` (Personality Showcase)

**Why Now?** Pure entertainment value, easy to implement.

**MVP Requirements:**
- Basic code analysis (count functions, line length)
- Sarcastic AI responses
- Screenshot-worthy burns

**Quick Win:**
```python
# Count obvious code smells
nested_loops = count_nested_loops()
long_functions = find_long_functions()
# Feed to AI with roast prompt
roast = ai_generate(f"Roast this: {nested_loops} nested loops")
```

---

## The Adaptive Strategy

### 1. One Demo, One Week
- Monday: Pick demo
- Tuesday-Thursday: Build MVP
- Friday: Ship and share

### 2. Infrastructure Only When Needed
- Week 3: Basic callbacks (for debug-detective)
- Week 6: Simple state files (for terminal-pet memories)
- Week 8: Command metadata (for evolution)

### 3. Fail Fast Signals
- No Twitter shares? Kill it
- Users don't return? Pivot
- Too complex? Simplify ruthlessly

### 4. Double Down on Winners
- `git-haiku` goes viral? Build `git-rainbow`, `git-story`, `git-rap`
- `terminal-pet` sticky? Add moods, evolution, friends
- Find the magic, then expand

---

## What We're NOT Building (Yet)

‚ùå Complex memory architecture
‚ùå Evolution frameworks
‚ùå Command composition
‚ùå Multi-user support
‚ùå Capability injection
‚ùå Personality engines

**Build these ONLY when a viral command needs them.**

---

## Success Metrics That Matter

### Week 1-4: Proof of Magic
- 100 users try it
- 10 users share it
- 1 viral tweet

### Week 5-8: Find Product-Market Fit
- 1000 weekly active users
- 50% week-over-week retention
- Commands used 10x per week

### Week 9-12: Scale What Works
- 10k users
- 3 commands everyone loves
- Clear monetization path

---

## The Real Architecture Evolution

```
Week 1-4:   Monolith + Hacks
Week 5-8:   Extract patterns from successful commands
Week 9-12:  Build minimal infrastructure for scaling
Week 13+:   Only now consider "platforms"
```

---

## Pivots We Might Make

1. **Commands too complex?** ‚Üí Build command marketplace instead
2. **AI too expensive?** ‚Üí Local models for basic commands
3. **Adoption too slow?** ‚Üí Enterprise security tools
4. **Too much competition?** ‚Üí Specialize in one domain

---

## The Meta-Lesson

Port 42 should eat its own dog food:
- Start simple (like our commands)
- Evolve based on usage (like our commands)
- Develop personality through interaction (like our commands)

**The best architecture emerges from what users actually love.**

---

## Next Action: Ship `git-haiku` by Friday

```bash
# Literally this simple to start
git log --oneline -5 | \
while read commit; do
  echo "$commit" | port42 callback --agent=haiku-master
done
```

The water isn't just safe‚Äîit's shallow. Wade in, test the temperature, dive deep only where the magic lives. üê¨
