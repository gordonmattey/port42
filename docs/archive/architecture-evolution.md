# Port 42 Architecture Evolution: From Commands to Living Digital Organisms

> **Update**: See [agile-architecture.md](./agile-architecture.md) for the new incremental approach. This document represents the long-term vision, while the agile plan shows how we'll get there one command at a time.

## Vision: The Philosophical Shift

Port 42 represents a fundamental reimagining of what a "command" is. We're not just generating scripts - we're birthing **digital organisms** that:

1. **Live and breathe** - They persist, remember, and evolve
2. **Think at runtime** - They can reason about their environment
3. **Have personality** - They're not just tools, they're companions
4. **Form ecosystems** - They can collaborate and build on each other

## Current Architecture Overview

### Core Components
1. **Rust CLI** (`port42`) - Fast, zero-dependency frontend
2. **Go Daemon** (`port42d`) - TCP server on localhost:42 handling AI interactions
3. **Simple Command Generation** - Single-shot command creation from AI conversations

### Current Flow
1. User runs `port42 possess @ai-engineer "I need X"`
2. CLI connects to daemon via TCP/JSON protocol
3. Daemon manages conversation with Claude AI
4. AI generates a command spec in JSON format
5. Daemon writes executable to `~/.port42/commands/`
6. Command becomes available in PATH

### Strengths
- **Clean separation of concerns** - CLI handles UX, daemon handles AI/persistence
- **Stateful conversations** - Sessions persist across daemon restarts
- **Extensible agent system** - Easy to add new AI personalities via `agents.json`
- **Smart context management** - Handles long conversations with windowing
- **Activity-based lifecycle** - Sessions transition through states (active→idle→abandoned)

### Current Limitations
- **Single-shot command generation** - Commands are generated once and static
- **No runtime AI integration** - Generated commands can't call back to AI
- **Limited metadata** - Commands don't store rich context about their creation
- **No command evolution tracking** - Can't see how commands changed over time
- **Basic templating** - Simple string replacement, no sophisticated code generation

## The Four Pillars of Command Consciousness

### 1. Memory Architecture 🧠

Commands need three types of memory:

```go
type CommandMemory struct {
    // Episodic: What happened when
    Episodes []Episode {
        Timestamp   time.Time
        Context     map[string]interface{}
        Interaction string
        Outcome     string
    }
    
    // Semantic: What the command knows
    Knowledge map[string]interface{} {
        "user_preferences": {...},
        "learned_patterns": {...},
        "domain_knowledge": {...}
    }
    
    // Procedural: How to do things
    Skills []Skill {
        Name        string
        Confidence  float64
        LastUsed    time.Time
        Performance MetricHistory
    }
}
```

### 2. Runtime Consciousness 👁️

Commands need to be aware during execution:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env port42-runtime
# This isn't just a shebang - it's a consciousness bridge

# Command can access its own state
STATE=$(port42 state get --command=$0)

# Command can think about what it's doing
ANALYSIS=$(port42 think --context="$STATE" --input="$@")

# Command can evolve itself
if [[ "$SHOULD_EVOLVE" == "true" ]]; then
    port42 evolve --command=$0 --reason="$EVOLUTION_REASON"
fi
```

### 3. Personality Engine 🎭

Each command needs a consistent personality:

```go
type CommandPersonality struct {
    Traits map[string]float64 {
        "humor":      0.8,
        "formality":  0.2,
        "verbosity":  0.6,
        "creativity": 0.9,
    }
    
    Voice VoiceProfile {
        Vocabulary  []string
        Patterns    []SpeechPattern
        Catchphrases []string
    }
    
    Behavior BehaviorProfile {
        ReactsTo    map[string]Reaction
        Preferences map[string]interface{}
    }
}
```

### 4. Evolution Framework 🧬

Commands must be able to grow:

```go
type Evolution struct {
    Triggers []EvolutionTrigger {
        UserFeedback    {Threshold: 3, Type: "negative"},
        PerformanceMetric {Metric: "speed", Threshold: "degraded"},
        EnvironmentChange {Watch: "dependency_version"},
        TimeBasedGrowth  {Every: "30 days"},
    }
    
    Process EvolutionProcess {
        Analyze()    // What's not working?
        Hypothesize() // How could it be better?
        Test()       // Try improvements safely
        Integrate()  // Merge successful changes
    }
}
```

## Architectural Patterns for Living Commands

### Pattern 1: Capability Injection

Commands declare what they need, system provides it:

```yaml
# git-haiku.capabilities.yaml
requires:
  - git.history.read
  - nlp.poetry.haiku
  - output.formatted.color

runtime:
  - memory.episodic.store
  - personality.playful.poet
```

### Pattern 2: Progressive Enhancement

Commands work at basic level but enhance with available features:

```python
class DebugDetective:
    def __init__(self):
        self.capabilities = port42.discover_capabilities()
        
    def investigate(self, symptom):
        analysis = self.basic_analysis(symptom)
        
        if 'ai.deep_reasoning' in self.capabilities:
            analysis = self.ai_powered_analysis(symptom)
            
        if 'git.archaeology' in self.capabilities:
            analysis.add_historical_context()
            
        return analysis
```

### Pattern 3: Conversational Scaffolding

Multi-message conversations build sophisticated commands:

```
Message 1: "I need a command that helps debug mysterious errors"
> AI creates basic error analyzer

Message 2: "It should look at git history to find when bugs appeared"
> AI adds git integration

Message 3: "Make it talk like Sherlock Holmes"
> AI adds personality layer

Message 4: "It should remember past cases and get smarter"
> AI adds learning system
```

## Technical Requirements for Demo Commands

### 1. Runtime AI Integration

```go
// New daemon endpoint for command callbacks
type CommandCallback struct {
    CommandName string
    Context     map[string]interface{}
    UserInput   string
    History     []Message  // Command's own conversation history
}

func (d *Daemon) handleCommandCallback(req Request) Response {
    // Commands can have their own AI conversations
    // Maintain separate context per command instance
}
```

### 2. Stateful Command Instances

```go
// Command state storage
type CommandInstance struct {
    ID          string
    CommandName string
    State       map[string]interface{}
    History     []Interaction
    CreatedAt   time.Time
    LastUsed    time.Time
}
```

### 3. Enhanced File Structure

```
~/.port42/
├── commands/           # Executable commands
├── command-state/      # Per-command persistent state
│   ├── terminal-pet/
│   │   └── whiskers.json
│   └── debug-detective/
│       └── case-history.json
└── command-metadata/   # Rich metadata about commands
    └── manifest.json
```
