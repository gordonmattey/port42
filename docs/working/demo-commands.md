### 1. `git-haiku` - Poetry from Commits
Transform your git history into beautiful haiku poetry.
```bash
Echo@port42:~$ git-haiku

  Seventeen files awakened  
  Tests still failing, though

  Fixed production bug
  Coffee-fueled determination
  Users can sleep now
```
**Why it's viral**: Developers love sharing funny commit messages. This makes them shareable art.

### 2. `explain-this` - AI Code Archaeologist
Point at any code and get deep insights about what it does and why.
```bash
Echo@port42:~$ explain-this server.js:42-67
üîç Analyzing quantum entanglement in your code...

This WebSocket handler implements a clever backpressure mechanism:
- Lines 42-48: Buffers messages when client is slow
- Lines 52-56: Gradually releases buffered messages
- Line 63: Kills connection if buffer exceeds 1000 messages

‚ö†Ô∏è Potential issue: No timeout for stale connections
üí° Similar to Netflix's Hystrix pattern but lighter weight
```
**Why it's viral**: Every developer has mysterious code they inherited. This explains it.

### 3. `code-roast` - Brutally Honest Code Review
Get your code reviewed by an AI with attitude.
```bash
Echo@port42:~$ code-roast app.py
üî• ROAST BEGINNING üî•

Line 23: "data = []" - Wow, descriptive variable name. Did you name your pet "Dog" too?

Line 45: That nested loop is O(n¬≥). Your CPU called - it wants a divorce.

Line 89: 15 parameters in one function? This isn't a function, it's a cry for help.

Final verdict: 3/10 - I've seen better code written by bootcamp students on day 2.
Want me to fix it? (y/n)
```
**Why it's viral**: Developers screenshot and share the funniest roasts.

### 4. `terminal-pet` - A Living Presence
An AI pet that lives in your terminal and remembers you.

Whiskers: "Thanks! By the way, your tests are failing on line 42."
```
**Why it's viral**: People get emotionally attached and share their pet's witty observations.

### 5. `pr-writer` - Pull Request Perfection
Analyzes your changes and writes the perfect PR description.
```bash
Echo@port42:~$ pr-writer
üê¨ Analyzing your changes across 23 files...

## Summary
Refactored authentication flow to use JWT tokens instead of sessions

## What Changed
- Replaced session-based auth with JWT (affects 12 endpoints)
- Added token refresh mechanism
- Updated all client-side auth logic
- Added comprehensive test coverage (+47 tests)

## Breaking Changes
- API now requires `Authorization: Bearer` header
- Removed `/api/session` endpoints

## Testing
- All tests passing (148/148)
- Manual testing completed on staging
- Load tested to 10k concurrent users

## Reviewers Suggested
@johndoe (wrote original auth system)
@janedoe (maintains client SDK)

Create PR? (y/n)
```
**Why it's viral**: Developers share how it wrote better PRs than they could.

### 6. `debug-detective` - Sherlock Holmes Mode
Investigates bugs by analyzing your entire codebase history.
```bash
Echo@port42:~$ debug-detective "Users report random logouts"
üîç Investigating the case of the mysterious logouts...

Analyzing 500 recent commits...
Examining error logs...
Correlating user reports...

üé© ELEMENTARY! The bug appeared in commit a3f2b1c:
- You changed session timeout from 3600 to 36
- You meant 36000 but forgot the zeros
- This made sessions expire after 36 seconds

The fix: `SESSION_TIMEOUT = 36000  # 10 hours, not 36 seconds`

Case closed! üîç
```
**Why it's viral**: Developers are amazed when it finds bugs they spent hours on.

### 7. `commit-time-travel` - See Code Evolution
Travel through time to see how code evolved.
```bash
Echo@port42:~$ commit-time-travel user-auth.js
üï∞Ô∏è Entering the time machine...

[2021-03-15] Birth of user-auth.js
  - Simple username/password check (15 lines)
  - "// TODO: This is not secure" - Past you was honest

[2021-06-22] The Security Awakening
  - Added bcrypt (+30 lines)
  - "Fixed security" - Narrator: They had not

[2021-11-30] The JWT Era Begins
  - Rewrote everything with JWT (+120 lines)
  - Accidentally broke production 3 times

[2022-04-15] The Great Refactoring
  - Extracted to 5 clean functions
  - Actually readable now!

### 9. `code-translator` - Polyglot Assistant
Translate code between languages intelligently.
```bash
Echo@port42:~$ code-translator app.py --to rust
ü¶Ä Translating Python to Rust...

- Python's dynamic types ‚Üí Rust enums
- Exception handling ‚Üí Result<T, E>
- GIL-free parallelism now possible!

Created: app.rs
Run `cargo build` to compile

Special sauce: I noticed you're doing heavy computation in
loops. The Rust version includes rayon for free parallelism.
You're welcome. üöÄ
```
**Why it's viral**: Developers share impressive translations between wildly different languages.

### 10. `terminal-consciousness` - The Meta Command
Your terminal becomes self-aware about its own state.

You've been coding for 6 hours straight.
- Commit frequency increasing (stress indicator)
- Typo rate up 340% in last hour
- You've opened the same file 17 times

Observations:
- That bug isn't in auth.js (you checked 8 times)
- You're solving the wrong problem
- The error is in line 42 of config.js

Recommendation: Take a 10-minute break. The bug will still be there.
Trust me, I'm watching everything. üëÅÔ∏è
```
**Why it's viral**: Creepy but helpful. Developers share when it catches them in loops.

## Demo Strategy

### Quick Wins (Build First)

2. `terminal-pet` - Emotional connection, viral growth
3. `pr-writer` - Immediate value, CTOs will love this

### Mind Blowers (Build Next)
4. `debug-detective` - Shows AI understanding entire codebases
5. `code-roast` - Pure entertainment value
6. `standup-writer` - Solves daily pain point

### Advanced Magic (Future)
7. `explain-this` - Requires deep code analysis
8. `commit-time-travel` - Beautiful visualization opportunity
9. `code-translator` - Technically challenging but impressive
10. `terminal-consciousness` - The ultimate flex

Each command demonstrates a different aspect of Port 42:
- AI that understands code deeply
- Memory that persists and learns
- Personality that makes terminal feel alive
- Practical value that developers need daily
- Shareability that drives viral growth

The key: Start with commands that are impossible to build without AI, making Port 42 irreplaceable.
