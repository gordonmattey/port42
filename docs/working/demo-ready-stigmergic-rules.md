7. **Log Analysis Convergence** - File parsing + correlation logic
8. **Database Administration** - DB type detection + command templating
9. **Security Audit Constellation** - Security tool orchestration
10. **Documentation Emergence** - Template generation from code analysis

### MEDIUM-HIGH (1-2 weeks)
11. **Monitoring Dashboard** - TUI/terminal dashboard with real-time updates
12. **File Organization Intelligence** - ML-like pattern recognition
13. **Project Lifecycle** - Complex template system + dependency management
14. **Team Workflow Detector** - API integrations (Slack, etc.)
15. **Daily Ritual Detector** - Time-based pattern analysis

### HIGH (2-4 weeks)
16. **Deployment Pipeline** - CI/CD orchestration + safety checks
17. **Working Directory Intelligence** - Context-aware command spawning
18. **Language-Specific Toolchain** - Deep language ecosystem integration
19. **Error Recovery Pattern** - Error diagnosis + automated fixing
20. **Efficiency Optimization** - Usage analytics + optimization suggestions

## üé™ PERFECT 5-MINUTE DEMO SEQUENCE

### Demo Script: "Terminal That Learns"
```bash
# Minute 1: Show current state
$ port42 ls /tools
$ port42 watch rules

# Minute 2: Create show commands naturally
$ port42 possess @ai-engineer
> "I want to see my git status nicely"
‚ú® Created: show-git-status

> "I need to show my current directory"  
‚ú® Created: show-pwd

> "Show me my running processes"
‚ú® Created: show-processes

# Minute 3: Watch the magic happen
$ port42 ls /tools
# show-all appears automatically!

$ port42 cat /tools/show-all
# Shows it was auto-spawned by rule engine

# Minute 4: Test the emergent intelligence
$ show-all
# Runs all three show commands automatically

# Minute 5: Show the rule in action
$ port42 watch rules
# Shows "Show-All Aggregator Rule" triggered
```

### Demo Impact:
- **"It's reading my mind!"** - Commands appear without being asked
- **"It learned from my behavior!"** - Pattern recognition in action  
- **"My terminal is getting smarter!"** - Stigmergic intelligence demonstration
- **"I never programmed this!"** - Emergent behavior showcase

## üèÜ TOP 3 FOR MAXIMUM DEMO IMPACT

1. **Show-All Aggregator** - Simplest, most immediate "wow" factor
2. **Git Workflow Completer** - Relatable to developers, shows practical intelligence
3. **Project Lifecycle Rule** - Every developer's pain point - "It learned my setup routine!"

These three can be chained together in a 10-minute demo to show escalating intelligence levels!

## üéØ PRIORITY IMPLEMENTATION (One from each section)

### Pattern Detection Rules ‚Üí **Show-All Aggregator** (SIMPLE)
- Immediate impact, easy to implement
- Foundation for stigmergic intelligence demonstration

### Temporal Pattern Rules ‚Üí **Project Lifecycle Rule** (MEDIUM) 
- Universal developer pain point
- Shows sequence learning and anticipation
- High practical value

### Context-Aware Rules ‚Üí **Working Directory Intelligence Rule** (HIGH)
- Wait for later phases - too complex for initial demo

### Collaborative Intelligence Rules ‚Üí **Documentation Emergence Rule** (MEDIUM)
- Universal need, shows intelligence across different work types
- Creates doc-manager when user creates write-readme, generate-docs, update-changelog

### Adaptive Learning Rules ‚Üí **Error Recovery Pattern Rule** (HIGH)
- Wait for later phases - requires sophisticated error analysis

## üöÄ PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

**Start with these 3 rules (covers most impactful categories):**

1. **Show-All Aggregator** (SIMPLE) - Pattern Detection foundation
2. **Git Workflow Completer** (SIMPLE-MEDIUM) - Developer workflow intelligence  
3. **Project Lifecycle Rule** (MEDIUM) - Temporal pattern learning

**Phase 2 additions:**
4. **Documentation Emergence Rule** (MEDIUM) - Collaborative intelligence
5. **Config Manager Emergence Rule** (MEDIUM) - File organization intelligence

This gives us a solid foundation covering:
- ‚úÖ Pattern Detection (show-all)
- ‚úÖ Workflow Intelligence (git-flow) 
- ‚úÖ Temporal Learning (new-project)
- ‚úÖ Documentation Intelligence (doc-manager)
- ‚úÖ Organization Intelligence (config-manager)
