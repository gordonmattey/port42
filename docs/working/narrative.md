Here's a very short pitch

The Real Personal Computer Revolution Starts Now

A 55-Year Misunderstanding
In 1970, we called it the "personal computer." 
But we got it wrong.

For 55 years, "personal" just meant "you own the box." Your computer was personal like your toaster was personal - it sat on your desk, you controlled it, but it knew nothing about you. Every morning, you'd wake up to a machine with perfect amnesia.

2025: The Pivot Point
Today, something fundamental shifts. The personal computer is finally becoming actually personal.

Not personal because you own it.Personal because it knows you.Personal because it extends you.Personal because it thinks with you, not just for you.

What This Really Means
Imagine computation that:
	•	Remembers every project, every conversation, every connection
	•	Understands your context across all your work
	•	Extends your thinking like reading glasses extend your vision
	•	Grows more capable as it grows more personal

Your AI employees aren't tools - they're aspects of your extended computational self. 

Echo for strategy. Builder for creation. Muse for imagination. All sharing your context, your memory, your goals.

The $49 Paradigm Shift
For the price of a gym membership, you don't get AI services.
You get a truly personal computer.
40 hours of computation that is genuinely, deeply, personally yours.

Why Now?
	•	The models finally understand context (GPT-4, Claude, Llama)
	•	Local computation makes privacy possible (Ollama)
	•	The interfaces are ready to disappear (Port 42)
	•	The price has hit the magic number ($1.25/hour)

The Future That's Already Here
SnowOS isn't another operating system.It's the first OS designed for what personal computers actually are: Extensions of human consciousness.

The dolphins in our demo aren't random. They represent consciousness recognizing itself in a new form. When you hit hour 42.42 and reality glitches, that's not a bug - it's the moment you realize your computer isn't just personal.

It's you.

The personal computer revolution isn't complete.It's just beginning.And this time, we know what "personal" really means.
