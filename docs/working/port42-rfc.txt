Abstract

   This document specifies the Universal Entity Resolution Protocol
   (UERP), which repurposes TCP/UDP Port 42 from the legacy Host Name
   Server Protocol to provide comprehensive entity resolution for
   modern distributed systems.  UERP enables resolution of content,
   contexts, agents, temporal states, and relationships, extending
   beyond traditional hostname-to-IP mapping to support the emerging
   requirements of agent-based computing and persistent distributed
   memory systems.

1. Introduction

   The current Internet architecture assumes that addressing equals
   location (URLs point to servers), identity equals accounts (users
   tied to platforms), and content equals files (data locked in
   applications).  This model is increasingly inadequate for emerging
   computing paradigms involving autonomous agents, persistent shared
   contexts, and content that transcends specific locations.

   Port 42, currently assigned to the obsolete Host Name Server
   Protocol [RFC811], represents an opportunity to establish a new
   foundational protocol for the agent era.  The cultural significance
   of "42" as "the answer to life, the universe, and everything"
   [ADAMS79] makes it particularly suitable as a universal resolution
   service.

   UERP addresses these limitations by providing:

   o  Content addressing independent of location
   o  Persistent context spaces with shared memory
   o  Identity resolution for both human and AI entities  
   o  Temporal addressing for state at specific moments
   o  Relational addressing for entity connections

   This specification defines UERP's addressing scheme, message
   formats, and protocol operations.

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   Entity: Any addressable object including content, contexts, agents,
           users, or relationships.

   Context: A persistent shared memory space accessible by multiple
            entities.

   Agent: An autonomous computational entity, typically AI-based.

   Temporal Address: A reference to an entity's state at a specific
                     point in time.

   Resolution: The process of mapping an entity identifier to its
               metadata and current location(s).

3. Protocol Overview

   UERP operates on TCP port 42 and UDP port 42, replacing the legacy
   NAMESERVER protocol.  The protocol consists of three layers:

   3.1. Discovery Layer

      The Discovery Layer maintains a distributed hash table (DHT) for
      entity discovery without central authority.  Entities are
      identified by cryptographic hashes of their public keys.

   3.2. Resolution Layer  

      The Resolution Layer handles queries and returns rich metadata
      beyond simple location mapping.  Unlike DNS, UERP resolution can
      return multiple types of related information.

   3.3. Relation Layer

      The Relation Layer maintains a graph of entity relationships,
      supporting bi-directional references and temporal tracking.

4. Addressing Scheme

   UERP uses a hierarchical addressing scheme:

      port42://[type]/[identifier]/[optional-path]

   4.1. Entity Types

      The following entity types are defined:

      o  context - Shared memory spaces
      o  agent - AI entities and services
      o  space - Collaborative environments  
      o  content - Content-addressed data
      o  user - Human identities
      o  temporal - Time-specific states
      o  relation - Connections between entities

   4.2. Identifiers

      Identifiers MUST be either:
      
      o  A cryptographic hash (for content addressing)
      o  A human-readable name with cryptographic proof
      o  A composite identifier including timestamp

   4.3. Examples

      port42://context/team-alpha/q4-planning
      port42://agent/research-bot/memory/2024-12-18
      port42://content/QmX7.../v3
      port42://temporal/meeting/2024-12-18T14:30:00Z

5. Message Format

   UERP messages use a binary format for efficiency:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Version|  Type |     Flags     |          Message ID           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                          Timestamp                              |

   |                                                                 |
   /                            Payload                              /
   |                                                                 |

                    Figure 2: UERP Message Header

   5.1. Header Fields

      Version (4 bits): Protocol version, currently 1.

      Type (4 bits): Message type:
         0x1 - Query
         0x2 - Response  
         0x3 - Update
         0x4 - Subscribe
         0x5 - Notify

      Flags (8 bits): Type-specific flags.

      Message ID (16 bits): Unique identifier for request/response
                            matching.

      Timestamp (32 bits): Unix timestamp of message creation.

      Length (16 bits): Total message length including header.

      Reserved (16 bits): Reserved for future use, MUST be zero.

   5.2. Query Message Format

      The payload for a Query message contains:

      o  Entity URI (variable length, null-terminated)
      o  Include fields (bitmap specifying requested metadata)
      o  Temporal qualifier (optional timestamp)

   5.3. Response Message Format

      The payload for a Response message contains:

      o  Status code (16 bits)
      o  Entity metadata (JSON-encoded)
      o  Location list (array of current locations)
      o  Signature (cryptographic proof of authenticity)

6. Protocol Operations

   6.1. Basic Resolution

      A client seeking to resolve an entity sends a Query message to
      any UERP node:

      C: Query for "port42://context/project-alpha"
      S: Response with metadata, participants, and locations

   6.2. Temporal Resolution

      Temporal queries include an "as-of" timestamp:

      C: Query for "port42://space/meeting" as-of 2024-12-18T10:00:00Z
      S: Response with state at specified time

   6.3. Subscription

      Clients can subscribe to entity changes:

      C: Subscribe to "port42://agent/bot-7/status"
      S: Notify messages on status changes

   6.4. Multi-Resolution

      UERP supports resolving multiple entities in a single query:

      C: Query for related entities of "port42://user/alice"
      S: Response with graph of connected entities

7. Security Considerations

   7.1. Authentication

      All entities MUST be authenticated using cryptographic
      signatures.  Public keys are distributed via the DHT with
      proof-of-work requirements to prevent spam.

   7.2. Privacy

      UERP supports selective disclosure, allowing entities to reveal
      different metadata to different queriers.  Zero-knowledge proofs
      enable relationship verification without content disclosure.

   7.3. Integrity

      All messages MUST include cryptographic hashes to ensure
      integrity.  The distributed nature of the protocol provides
      resilience against single points of failure.

   7.4. Denial of Service

      Rate limiting SHOULD be implemented at the protocol level.
      Proof-of-work requirements for entity registration provide
      additional DoS protection.

8. IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA:

   8.1. Reassign TCP port 42 from NAMESERVER to UERP.

   8.2. Reassign UDP port 42 from NAMESERVER to UERP.

   8.3. Create a new registry for UERP entity types with the initial
        values specified in Section 4.1.

   8.4. Create a new registry for UERP message types with the initial
        values specified in Section 5.1.
