port42 declare tool log-incident-analyzer --transforms "logs,analysis,patterns,errors" \
  --ref file:/tmp/sample.log
```

**Show the generated tool:**
```bash
# Tool is instantly available
log-incident-analyzer /tmp/sample.log

# Explore what was created
port42 cat /commands/log-incident-analyzer
port42 ls /tools/log-incident-analyzer/
```

**Then use possession to explore:**
```bash
# Use AI to understand and improve existing tools
